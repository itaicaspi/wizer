So is there a way to convert heat without temp difference? Thanks in advance :)"

    "description": "I have a sapient (alien) species that behaves more or less similarly to humans, and that includes their romantic interactions. However, although they court/date each other much like we do, there is a certain mechanic that shapes their cultural understanding of romance. If a courting pair of these creatures lock gazes and share a warm fuzzy \"love struck\" moment, as we might describe it, their pheromone production spikes, and the ensuing surge of endorphins is so strong that it rewires their brains permanently, devoting the two individuals to each other for the rest of their lives. Pairs who have had this bonding moment have zero interest in infidelity and simply can't fathom getting a divorce, no matter how much they might argue. Non-bonded pairs exist too, but they are much rarer than bonded pairs and are generally either judged or pitied by the rest of society.",
